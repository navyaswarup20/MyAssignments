/*Consider a CUI based application, where you are asking a user to enter his Login name and password, after entering the valid user-id and password it will print the message “Welcome” along with user name. As per the validation is concerned, the program should keep a track of login attempts. After three attempts a message should be flashed saying “Contact Admin” and the program should terminate.              

Description:-

You have to create a CUI based application in which you will declare and initialize the userId and password.You have to enter the credentials when you login to the application(when you run the program it should ask the user to enter the credentials),if the entered credentials are validated correctly you should see a welcome message with the userId or else you should have total 3 attempts to enter the correct credentials.If you fail to enter the right credentials in your 3rd attempt you should display a message "Contact Admin".
